{"name":"Pith.","tagline":"The Pith media hub at the center of your entertainment network","body":"Pith is the central hub that connects your storage, your media devices and your mobile devices. It sits on your server, you control it through your mobile device and it plays media through your TV, AV receiver or other playback device.\r\n\r\n### The server.\r\nThe only software you need to install is the Pith server on your NAS or computer. It maintains a library of media that's on there; it will scan local media, try to fetch relevant metadata from internet sources, and catalog everything in many convenient ways.\r\n\r\n### The interface.\r\nPith presents an easy-to-use web interface on your tablet, laptop or smartphone from which all interaction takes place. You use it to browse your media library, and control playback. Browse movies by title, year, rating or even actor. Play, seek, pause playback with a single touch or click.\r\n\r\n### The player.\r\nPith is designed from the ground up to be able to support many networked media playback devices. In the first release, support is limited to UPnP/DLNA enabled devices, but the goal is to support many more (e.g. AirPlay, Squeezebox, Chromecast, ...).\r\n\r\n# How does it work (technically)?\r\nPith is a node.js application that can be run on your computer or NAS. It exposes a web interface, as well as a JSON REST api and a media streaming service through http.\r\nThe web interface is single page static html, and communicates with pith exclusively through the REST api and Websockets (for realtime feedback). It is built on Angular and Bootstrap 3.0, and can be used as a fullscreen web app on iPad so it looks virtually indistinguishable from a native app.\r\nPith can be used with MongoDB for metadata storage, or using the integrated TingoDB database. Periodic scans on user defined paths scan for new media which is then cataloged in the database. Metadata is obtained from themoviedb.com.\r\nPlayback is currently limited to UPnP/DLNA devices; it has been tested successfully with Panasonic Viera devices, Yamaha A-830 and XBMC.\r\n\r\n# How to get started\r\nPith is currently still in an early stage. No official release has been made yet, but if you want to tinker you can checkout the code from our Github repository. Instructions can be found in the README.md file.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
