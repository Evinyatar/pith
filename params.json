{"name":"Pith.","tagline":"The Pith media hub at the center of your entertainment network","body":"Pith is the central hub that connects your storage, your media devices and your mobile devices. It sits on your server, you control it through your mobile device and it plays media through your TV, AV receiver or other playback device.\r\n\r\n### The server.\r\nThe only software you need to install is the Pith server on your NAS or computer. It maintains a library of media that's on there.\r\n\r\n### The interface.\r\nPith presents an easy-to-use web interface on your tablet, laptop or smartphone from which all interaction takes place. You use it to browse your media library, and control playback.\r\n\r\n### The player.\r\nPith is designed from the ground up to be able to support many networked media playback devices. In the first release, support is limited to UPnP/DLNA enabled devices, but the goal is to support many more (e.g. AirPlay, Squeezebox, Chromecast, ...).\r\n\r\n# How to get started\r\nPith is currently still in an early stage. No official release has been made yet, but if you want to tinker you can checkout the code from our Github repository. Instructions can be found in the README.md file.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
